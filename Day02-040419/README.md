# Numpy

#####  Day 02 of 100 days of ML 

-------------------------

Day 02 is all about numpy array. Numpy is python library (is a Linear Algebra Library for Python) which supports array, vector, matrix caculations. 
Somethings that I leant from numpy array for day 02: 

### 1. Numpy initial from bunch of different ways:
    - Initializing numpy array from list
    - From built-in methods: zeros, ones, full, empty, arange, eye, random
### 2. How to index numpy array
### 3. Numpy math operations
### 4. Numpy manipulation and miscellaneous
    - Broadcasting
    - Datatypes
    - Shape and reshape
    - Flatten
    - Aggregate
    - ...
### 5. [How to iterate over numpy array](NumpyArrayIterator.ipynb)
